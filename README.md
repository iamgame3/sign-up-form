# Sign-up Form Project
This project is meant to test my understanding of forms, pseudo-elements, pseudo-classes, and a few other minor things. This is also the first project in which I am using a CSS normalizer.

This project is pretty simple to test out, just enter some information and click submit. The information isn't actually sent anywhere, which you can see if you look in the source code.

This project was a part of The Odin Project's course, hence the Odin Logo on the side of the page.
